      <p style="color:white;font-family:Arial;text-indent:40px;">rats, like all other animals, need a balanced and fortified diet to be healthy. they need their own food, and eating only
      table scraps won't be healthy for them. rats are <span style="color:red">omnivores</span>, meaning they eat both plant and animal matter. a rat's weight doesn't always
      correlate to their health; a rat can be both overweight and malnourished. diet can be a complex issue, but it doesn't have to be! while many commercial mixes or blocks
      are unsuitable for rats, there are a few good ones out there.</p>
      <h2 style="color:white;font-family:Arial">the basics</h2>
      <p style="color:white;font-family:Arial;text-indent:40px;">not all diets are made equal. each diet is
        composed of different ingredients, nutritional contents, etc. a good rat diet is one that is nutritionally
        complete and fulfills all of their needs. your rat relies on their diet for their growth and health, so
        it makes sense that what you choose is important. there are two main "kinds" of diets: lab blocks (may
        also be called pellets) and mixes. blocks are pellets that contain different ingredients and minerals.
        lab blocks help keep teeth in shape and prevents selective feeding. however, lab blocks can get expensive
        depending on how many rats you have. they also don't allow for changes that need to be made nutritionally.
        mixes are self-explanatory. by mixing ingredients together, you can tune it to the nutritional needs of your
        rats. mixes are very cheap and can be good if you know what you're doing. if there's a mineral or vitamin
        missing from your mix, you can add it. mixes are weak to selective feeding, but you can deal with this with
        how you feed your mixes. if your rats don't eat a certain part of the mix, they're missing something
        nutritionally.
      <p style="color:white;font-family:Arial;text-indent:40px;">lab blocks are more popular in the US, while mixes are more popular in the EU and other parts of the world.
        if you live in a place where lab blocks aren't available, mixes will be your best bet! while lab blocks are
        usually more popular, you can still find blocks that aren't nutritionally complete. most commercial mixes
        are also unsuitable (especially seed mixes).</p>
      <h2 style="color:white;font-family:Arial">a good diet vs a bad diet</h2>
      <table style="color:white;font-family:Arial">
        <tr>
          <th>good lab block</th>
          <th>bad lab block</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>protein content of 12/13-16%*</td>
          <td>too high or too low protein-wise</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>fat content of 4-6%</td>
          <td>fat content is too high</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>marketed towards rats specifically**</td>
          <td>marketed towards other small animals, like hamsters</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

          <td>low quality ingredients, or components like hay</td>

        <p style="color:grey;font-family:Arial;font-size:10px;">
        * harleys (a variety of rat) should have less than 15% protein, and breeding does can
        have up to 18% protein.<br>
        ** most rat foods are marketed to both rats and mice. however, they're only good for
        one, since mice have different nutritional needs. avoid general small animal food
        mixes.</p>
      <p style="color:white;font-family:Arial;text-indent:40px;">rats do best with a protein content of 12 percent
      to 16 percent (this may vary depending on a few factors). rats also do best with a fat content of 4 percent
      to 6 percent. something that's very important is quality of the ingredients used. here's a list of ingredients
      to avoid:</p>
      <ul style="color:white;font-family:Arial;">
    <li>bonemeal, wheatmeal, wheat feed</li>
    <li>any sort of hay, as it cannot be digested and therefore offers no nutrients</li>
    <li>vague ingredients that aren't fully listed on the bag or manufacturer website</li>
    <li><i>dried</i> corn â†’ US only. the US and the EU have different standards when it comes to dried corn. in the US, dried corn
    has higher amounts of toxins that can cause liver damage. like all foods, moderation is key.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 style="color:white;font-family:Arial">treats, supplements, and additional foods</h2>
      <p style="color:white;font-family:Arial;text-indent:40px;">treats are a good way to develop a bond with your rats. however, some treats are unhealthy or
        even dangerous, especially in high amounts. other than treats, some people like to give their rats extra food in addition to their diet. some also
        give their rats vitamins and extra supplements. this isn't always bad, but most of the time, it just isn't needed! when you're feeding a nutritionally
        complete block or mix, you don't need vitamins. in fact, most vitamins marketed towards rats are unnecessary, and you should only give your rats vitamins or
        supplements if you're sure they need them. <i>never</i> contaminate the only water
        source in the cage with vitamins. rats should always have access to clean drinking water.</p>
      <h2 style="color:white;font-family:Arial">water bowls vs water bottles</h2>
      <p style="color:white;font-family:Arial;text-indent:40px;">rats should always have access to water, and many owners do this via water bottles or bowls. which
        is better though? it all depends on your rats! some rats prefer bowls because they can use their hands to drink water. however, bowls can be pushed around
        easily, and can get pretty unhygenic. rats like to pee in water bowls, and they can fill up with bacteria fast. water bowls should be refilled and changed
        at least once a day. the best bowls are ones that attach to the bars of the cage. water bottles are pretty hygenic, and get messy only when they leak. it's up
        to you to decide which to use. when you use water bottles, make them high! rats should have to stretch to drink. sitting and drinking can prop their head at
        a weird angle that can strain them. </p>
