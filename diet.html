      <p style="color:white;font-family:Arial;text-indent:20px;">rats, like all other animals, need a balanced and fortified diet to be healthy. they need their own food, and eating only
      table scraps won't be healthy for them. rats are <span style="color:red">omnivores</span>, meaning they eat both plant and animal matter. a rat's weight doesn't always
      correlate to their health; a rat can be both overweight and malnourished. diet can be a complex issue, but it doesn't have to be! while many commerical mixes or blocks
      are unsuitable for rats, there are a few good ones out there.</p>
      <h3 style="color:white;font-family:Arial;text-indent:20px;">the basics</h3>
      <p style="color:white;font-family:Arial;text-indent:20px;">not all diets are made equal. each diet is
        composed of different ingredients, nutritional contents, etc. a good rat diet is one that is nutritionally
        complete and fufills all of their needs. your rat relies on their diet for their growth and health, so
        it makes sense that what you choose is important. there are two main "kinds" of diets: lab blocks (may
        also be called pellets) and mixes. blocks are pellets that contain different ingredients and minerals.
        lab blocks help keep teeth in shape and prevents selective feeding. however, lab blocks can get expensive
        depending on how many rats you have. they also don't allow for changes that need to be made nutritionally.
        mixes are self-explanatory. by mixing ingredients together, you can tune it to the nutritional needs of your
        rats. mixes are very cheap and can be good if you know what you're doing. if there's a mineral or vitamin
        missing from your mix, you can add it. mixes are weak to selective feeding, but you can deal with this with
        how you feed your mixes. if your rats don't eat a certain part of the mix, they're missing something
        nutritonally.<br>
        lab blocks are more popular in the US, while mixes are more popular in the EU and other parts of the world.
        if you live in a place where lab blocks aren't available, mixes will be your best bet! while lab blocks are
        usually more popular, you can still find blocks that aren't nutritionally complete. most commercial mixes
        are also unsuitable (especially seed mixes).
